  title: "Our Story",
  content: `MutaEngine was born out of a simple realization: traditional methods of software protection were no longer sufficient in an age where hackers are constantly finding new ways to bypass security measures. Our founders set out to create a solution that could adapt and evolve in real-time, providing a level of protection that static methods simply couldnâ€™t match. 
  
  What started as a small project has grown into a leading solution trusted by developers and companies around the world. Today, MutaEngine continues to innovate, constantly improving our technology to meet the challenges of tomorrow.`,
